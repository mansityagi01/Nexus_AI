# Requirements Document

## Introduction

NexusAI is an autonomous IT operations platform designed as a hackathon prototype to demonstrate sophisticated multi-agent AI systems for IT management. The platform features a Master Agent for intelligent ticket triage and specialized agents (starting with PhishGuard) for autonomous threat remediation. The system includes a real-time web dashboard that visualizes the entire agent workflow from ticket creation to resolution, showcasing the future of autonomous IT operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a hackathon judge, I want to see a fully functional autonomous IT operations platform that can process tickets without external dependencies, so that I can evaluate the technical sophistication and practical value of the solution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize both MCP tool server and Flask-SocketIO server automatically
2. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a modern, professional interface without requiring external API accounts
3. WHEN the system processes tickets THEN it SHALL operate entirely self-contained with simulated tool responses
4. IF the system encounters errors THEN it SHALL handle them gracefully and continue operation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create IT support tickets through a web interface, so that I can simulate real-world IT scenarios for demonstration purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the web dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a ticket creation form
2. WHEN I enter a ticket subject and submit THEN the system SHALL create a unique ticket ID and begin processing
3. WHEN a ticket is created THEN the system SHALL emit real-time updates to the dashboard
4. WHEN I submit an empty subject THEN the system SHALL prevent ticket creation and show appropriate feedback

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want tickets to be automatically triaged by an AI agent, so that they can be routed to the appropriate specialist agents without human intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a ticket is created THEN the Master Agent SHALL analyze the subject line
2. WHEN the Master Agent processes a ticket THEN it SHALL classify it as either 'Phishing/Security' or 'General Inquiry'
3. WHEN classification is complete THEN the system SHALL route the ticket to the appropriate specialist agent
4. WHEN no specialist agent is available THEN the system SHALL escalate for manual review

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want phishing threats to be automatically investigated and remediated, so that the organization can respond faster than humanly possible to security incidents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a ticket is classified as 'Phishing/Security' THEN the PhishGuard Agent SHALL be activated
2. WHEN PhishGuard Agent starts THEN it SHALL analyze the ticket for Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
3. WHEN malicious URLs are identified THEN the system SHALL block them at the network level
4. WHEN threats are identified THEN the system SHALL search and remove malicious emails from all user inboxes
5. WHEN remediation is complete THEN the system SHALL log a resolution summary

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want to see real-time visualization of the agent workflow, so that I can understand how the autonomous system operates and builds confidence in its capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents perform actions THEN the dashboard SHALL display real-time log updates
2. WHEN ticket status changes THEN the UI SHALL update the status indicator with appropriate colors and animations
3. WHEN multiple tickets are processed THEN the dashboard SHALL display them in chronological order
4. WHEN agents use tools THEN the system SHALL log each tool invocation for transparency

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system built with modern, recommended technologies, so that it demonstrates technical competency and follows industry best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the backend THEN the system SHALL use Python with Flask and Flask-SocketIO
2. WHEN implementing agents THEN the system SHALL use Strands Agents SDK framework
3. WHEN implementing tools THEN the system SHALL use Model Context Protocol (MCP)
4. WHEN implementing AI capabilities THEN the system SHALL integrate with Google Gemini API
5. WHEN implementing the frontend THEN the system SHALL use Svelte with Tailwind CSS
6. WHEN building the UI THEN it SHALL feature glassmorphism effects and dark, futuristic styling

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to have professional project structure and documentation, so that it can be easily understood, maintained, and extended.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the project THEN it SHALL follow the specified directory structure with clear separation of concerns
2. WHEN reviewing the code THEN each module SHALL have appropriate imports and error handling
3. WHEN setting up the project THEN it SHALL include comprehensive README with setup instructions
4. WHEN configuring the system THEN it SHALL use environment variables for sensitive configuration
5. WHEN installing dependencies THEN it SHALL include complete requirements.txt and package.json files

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want the system to handle API keys and sensitive data securely, so that the application follows security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring API access THEN the system SHALL use environment variables for API keys
2. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL validate required environment variables are present
3. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL not log or expose API keys
4. WHEN distributing the code THEN it SHALL include .env example files without actual secrets

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a demonstrator, I want the phishing remediation workflow to be visually impressive and technically accurate, so that it showcases the platform's capabilities effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN demonstrating phishing remediation THEN the workflow SHALL complete all steps: analyze, contain, eradicate, document
2. WHEN tools are invoked THEN they SHALL simulate realistic response times and outputs
3. WHEN the workflow completes THEN it SHALL show measurable results (e.g., "15 emails removed")
4. WHEN displaying progress THEN the UI SHALL use smooth animations and professional status indicators

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a hackathon participant, I want the system to be cost-effective and efficient, so that it can be developed and demonstrated within budget constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using AI services THEN the system SHALL optimize API calls to minimize costs
2. WHEN running demonstrations THEN the system SHALL use simulated responses where appropriate
3. WHEN processing multiple tickets THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently without performance degradation
4. WHEN the system is idle THEN it SHALL not consume unnecessary resources
